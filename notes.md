# ðŸŒŸ Node Js Notes :-

## ðŸŒŸ What is Node Js :-
- **`Node.js` is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser, typically on the server side.** It was created by [Ryan Dahl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Dahl) in 2009 and is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, **which compiles JavaScript into machine code for fast execution**.
- `Node.js`s is a open source server enviornment.
- `Node.js` is a free.
- `Node.js` use javascript on the server.
- `Node.js` runs on various platform (Windows, Linux, Unix ,Mac Os etc.)

## ðŸŒŸ What Can Node.js Do ? :-
- `Node.js` can generate dynamic page content.
- `Node.js` can create, read, write, open, close and delete files on the server.
- `Node.js` can collect form data.
- `Node.js` can add, delete, modify data in our database.

## ðŸŒŸ Why Node.js is Used ? :-
- `Node.js` is used primarily for building scalable and high-performance network applications, such as web servers, real-time chat applications, REST APIs, and more.

1. **Fast Execution :-** Thanks to the V8 engine, Node.js executes JavaScript code very quickly.
2. **Single Programming Language (JavaScript) :-** With `Node.js`, developers can use JavaScript for both the frontend and backend, simplifying development and reducing the need to switch contexts or learn multiple languages.
3. **Large Ecosystem (npm) :-**  `Node.js` has a massive package ecosystem via npm (Node Package Manager)â€”one of the largest repositories of open-source libraries.
4. **Asynchronous and Event-Driven :-** `Node.js` uses non-blocking I/O and event-driven architecture, meaning it can handle many connections at once without waiting for operations (like file reads or database queries) to finish.
5. **Scalability :-** Its architecture makes it suitable for building scalable applications, especially for I/O-heavy operations like streaming, chat, or API servers.


## ðŸŒŸ Common Use Cases of Node.js :-
1. **Web Servers & REST APIs :-** Build backend services that handle HTTP requests and interact with databases.
2. **Real-Time Applications :-** Chat apps, multiplayer games, and collaborative tools (using WebSockets).
3. **Streaming Applications :-** Used by platforms like Netflix for real-time media streaming.
4. **Microservices :-**  Node.js works well with microservices architecture due to its lightweight nature.
5. **IoT Applications :-**  Used in Internet of Things due to its event-driven and non-blocking architecture.
6. **Serverless Architecture :-**  Node.js is a top choice for AWS Lambda and other serverless platforms.

## ðŸŒŸ Some Important Notes:-
- `__dirname` :- This returns abosolute directory path where `.js` file located.
- `__filename` :- This returns abosolute file location path where `.js` file located.
